To start, let me introduce myself quickly :
My name is Paul Laine, i'm 24 and i'm currently studying for a Master's degree in Computer Science at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. 
As part of the validation of my education program, I am looking for a 6-month internship as a Data Scientist, starting in September 2021, in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Now that you know me better, let me explain you what i intend to do with this gitbhub profile.
